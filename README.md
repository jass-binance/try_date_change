# Installation

For homebrew users, you need to run `brew tap PotatoLabs/homebrew-git-redate` and then `brew install git-redate`.

If you're not using homebrew, you can clone this repo and move the `git-redate` file into any folders in your $PATH. Restart your terminal afterwards and you're good to go!

# Usage

`git redate --commits [[number of commits to view]]`. 

The `--commits` (a.k.a. `-c`) argument is optional, and defaults to 5 if not provided.
